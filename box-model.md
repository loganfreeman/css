Normal Flow
---
*Boxes in the normal flow belong to a formatting context, which may be `block` or `inline`, but not both simultaneously. `Block-level` boxes participate in a block formatting context. `Inline-level` boxes participate in an inline formatting context.*

Collapsing margins
---
*In CSS, the adjoining margins of two or more boxes (which might or might not be siblings) can combine to form a single margin. Margins that combine this way are said to collapse, and the resulting combined margin is called a collapsed margin.*

line box
---
*In an inline formatting context, boxes are laid out horizontally, one after the other, beginning at the top of a containing block. Horizontal margins, borders, and padding are respected between these boxes. The boxes may be aligned vertically in different ways: their bottoms or tops may be aligned, or the baselines of text within them may be aligned. The rectangular area that contains the boxes that form a line is called a `line box`.*
